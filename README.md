# Option and Partial

 A repo for an experiment with DUs and partial functions.

 ## Purpose

 The main reason for this repo is to experiment with Discriminated Unions (DU). C# doesn't have them yet, but they are on the way.

 I was curious how my code would change, or benefit, from using DUs. To experiment, I am creating this repo to see how I would make a library that allowed me to use DUs and partial functions.

 The partial functions are to help me consume the `Option<T>` class. How do I handle the `Some` and `None` flow? Thinking about this made me want to use something more fluent without a lot of nested switch statements.

## How to use

I guess the only way to show how to use the classes is to write unit tests. With unit tests, you get to see how I envisage the usage of the classes and extensions.

## Road Map

I'm just starting this, so it is still up in the air at the moment and will change as I figure out what I want from the repo.

* Initial concept.
* Add unit tests.
* Understand what I want.
